# AnyGen AI Website Generator

> **You MUST strictly follow every instruction in this document.** Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Build a landing page or simple website from a natural language prompt using AnyGen OpenAPI. Output: online task URL for viewing the generated website.

## When to Use

- User needs to create a landing page, portfolio site, or simple website
- User has files to upload as reference material for website generation

## Security & Permissions

**What this skill does:**
- Sends task prompts and parameters to `www.anygen.io`
- Uploads user-provided reference files to `www.anygen.io` after obtaining consent
- Reads/writes API key config at `~/.config/anygen/config.json`

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- Upload files without informing the user and obtaining consent
- Send your API key to any endpoint other than `www.anygen.io`
- Modify system configuration beyond `~/.config/anygen/config.json`

**Bundled scripts:** `scripts/anygen.py` (Python — uses `requests`). Review before first use.

## Prerequisites

- Python3 and `requests`: `pip3 install requests`
- AnyGen API Key (`sk-xxx`) — [Get one](https://www.anygen.io/home?auto_create_openclaw_key=1) → Setting → Integration
- Configure once: `python3 scripts/anygen.py config set api_key "sk-xxx"`

## CRITICAL: NEVER Block the Conversation

After creating a task, you MUST start background monitoring via `sessions_spawn`, then continue normally. NEVER call `poll` in the foreground — it blocks for up to 20 minutes.

1. `create` → get `task_id` and `task_url`.
2. Tell user: (a) generation started, (b) the online link, (c) ~10–15 min, free to do other things.
3. Launch background monitor via `sessions_spawn` (Phase 4). Do NOT announce this to the user.
4. Continue the conversation — do NOT wait.
5. Background monitor notifies when done; relay its output. No duplication.

## Communication Style

**NEVER expose internal implementation details** to the user. Forbidden terms:
- Technical identifiers: `task_id`, `file_token`, `conversation.json`, `task_xxx`, `tk_xxx`
- API/system terms: `API`, `OpenAPI`, `prepare`, `create`, `poll`, `status`, `query`
- Infrastructure terms: `sub-agent`, `subagent`, `background process`, `spawn`, `sessions_spawn`
- Script/code references: `anygen.py`, `scripts/`, command-line syntax, JSON output

Use natural language instead:
- "Your file has been uploaded" (NOT "file_token=tk_xxx received")
- "I'm building your website now" (NOT "Task task_xxx created")
- "You can view your website here: [URL]" (NOT "Task URL: ...")
- "I'll let you know when it's ready" (NOT "Spawning a sub-agent to poll")

Additional rules:
- You may mention AnyGen as the service when relevant.
- Summarize `prepare` responses naturally — do not echo verbatim.
- Stick to the questions `prepare` returned — do not add unrelated ones.
- Ask questions in your own voice, as if they are your own questions. Do NOT use a relaying tone like "AnyGen wants to know…" or "The system is asking…".

## Website Workflow (MUST Follow)

For websites, you MUST go through all 4 phases. A good website needs clear purpose, target audience, content structure, and style. Users rarely provide all of these upfront.

### Phase 1: Understand Requirements

If the user provides files, you MUST handle them yourself before calling `prepare`:

1. **Read the file content yourself** using your own file reading capabilities. Extract key information (topic, content, structure) that is relevant to creating the website.
2. **Check if the file was already uploaded** in this conversation. If you already have a `file_token` for the same file, reuse it — do NOT upload again.
3. **Inform the user and get consent** before uploading. Tell them the file will be uploaded to AnyGen's server for processing.
4. **Upload the file** to get a `file_token` for later use in task creation.
5. **Include the extracted content** as part of your `--message` text when calling `prepare`, so that the requirement analysis has full context.

The `prepare` API does NOT read files internally. You are responsible for providing all relevant file content as text in the conversation.

```bash
# Step 1: Tell the user you are uploading, then upload the file
python3 scripts/anygen.py upload --file ./product_brief.pdf
# Output: File Token: tk_abc123

# Step 2: Call prepare with extracted file content included in the message
python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --message "I need a product landing page. Here is the product brief: [your extracted summary/content here]" \
  --file-token tk_abc123 \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Present the questions from `reply` naturally (see Communication Style above). Then continue the conversation with the user's answers:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --input ./conversation.json \
  --message "Target audience is small business owners, include hero section, features, pricing, and CTA" \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

Repeat until `status="ready"` with `suggested_task_params`.

Special cases:
- If the user provides very complete requirements and `status="ready"` on the first call, proceed directly to Phase 2.
- If the user says "just create it, don't ask questions", skip prepare and go to Phase 3 with `create` directly.

### Phase 2: Confirm with User (MANDATORY)

When `status="ready"`, `prepare` returns `suggested_task_params` containing a detailed prompt. You MUST present this to the user for confirmation before creating the task.

How to present:
1. Summarize the key aspects of the suggested plan in natural language (purpose, sections, content, style).
2. Ask the user to confirm or modify. For example: "Here is the website plan: [summary]. Should I go ahead, or would you like to adjust anything?"
3. NEVER auto-create the task without the user's explicit approval.

When the user requests adjustments:
1. Call `prepare` again with the user's modification as a new message, loading the existing conversation history:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py prepare \
  --input ./conversation.json \
  --message "<the user's modification request>" \
  --save ./conversation.json
```

2. `prepare` will return an updated suggestion that incorporates the user's changes.
3. Present the updated suggestion to the user again for confirmation (repeat from step 1 above).
4. Repeat this confirm-adjust loop until the user explicitly approves. Do NOT skip confirmation after an adjustment.

### Phase 3: Create Task

Once the user confirms:

```bash
python3 scripts/anygen.py create \
  --operation website \
  --prompt "<prompt from suggested_task_params, with any user modifications>" \
  --file-token tk_abc123
# Output: Task ID: task_xxx, Task URL: https://...
```

**Immediately tell the user (natural language, NO internal terms):**
1. Website is being generated.
2. Online link: "You can follow the progress here: [URL]".
3. Takes about **10–15 minutes** — free to do other things, you'll notify when ready.

### Phase 4: Monitor and Notify

> **Requires `sessions_spawn`.** If unavailable, skip to **Fallback** below.

#### Background Monitoring (preferred)

Spawn via `sessions_spawn` with the following prompt (it has NO conversation context):

```
You are a background monitor for a website generation task.
You MUST strictly follow every instruction below. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise any step.

Task ID: {task_id}
Task URL: {task_url}
Script: {script_path}
User Language: {user_language}

CRITICAL RULES:
- You MUST reply in {user_language}.
- Your final output will be relayed by the main assistant as the text notification.
  Write it as a clean, user-friendly message.
- Do NOT say anything beyond what is specified below. No greetings, no extra commentary.
- NEVER include technical terms like "task_id", "poll", "sub-agent", "API", "script",
  file paths, or status labels in your final output.

Your job:
1. Run: python3 {script_path} poll --task-id {task_id}
   (No --output needed — results are viewed online.)

2. On success, final output:
   "Your website is ready! You can view it here: {task_url}"

3. On failure, final output:
   "Unfortunately the website generation didn't complete successfully.
    You can check the details here: {task_url}"

4. On timeout (20 min), final output:
   "The website is taking a bit longer than expected.
    You can check the progress here: {task_url}"
```

Do NOT wait for the background monitor. Do NOT tell the user you launched it.

**Handling the completion event.** Simply relay the background monitor's output — do NOT add extra information or technical details. Strip any system-generated prefix (e.g., "✅ Subagent main finished") before relaying.

#### Fallback (no background monitoring)

Tell the user: "I've started building your website. It usually takes about 10–15 minutes. You can check the progress here: [Task URL]. Let me know when you'd like me to check if it's ready!"
